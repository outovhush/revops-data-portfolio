Showcasing some examples of my work in sales and revenue operations

Hey there! I'm Andrew üëã

Ever heard of Revenue Operations (RevOps)? It's the rather new word in business, and it's shaking things up a bit. Imagine a superhero team where sales, marketing, and customer service all work together aligned perfectly to make more money. And the infrastructure and automation ensures that work is done in most effective ways. That's the RevOps product! More and more SMB companies are catching on, realising it's not just a fad but a real thing. Curious about why it's such a big deal?

So, why am I the right person for RevOps? Well, I've done a bit of everything. I can see the big picture but also know how to get things aligned day-to-day. It's like being able to plan an awesome party and also know how to set up the decorations. I'm good at talking to different teams, understanding what they need, and finding ways to balance their needs and hit the revenue goals.

Now, let's talk about data. It's super important in on the operations side of things, but here's the thing ‚Äì real-world data is messy. It's not like the neat stuff you see in titanic dataset. My job is to clean it up, make sense of it, and turn it into useful information. With the right tools, like a good CRM system, we can track everything important, get insights and make better business decisions.

Want to see how I've put all this into action? Check out some examples of my work below üëáüèº

## Business Analysis and BP Engineering
### BPMN examples for process analysis and reference

__Goal:__ Provide a visual representation of the business process for the various use cases (business analysis, onboarding new reps) 

__Skills:__ Business analysis, BPMN

__Tech:__ 

__Results:__:



## Business and Revenue Modelling
### Down-top one page revenue models to sanity check and forecast

## Operational reporting and BI

### Ad-hoc analytics focused on the reps' performance and deal lost reasons

Once in a while you spot an anomaly on the operating dashboards and need a quick dive into the specific area of the revenue or sales flow. Data is clean and the basics tools would do the job fast.

__Goal:__ Assess the reps performance on the deals that take longer to close; get insights and support the decision making  

__Skills:__ Sales KPIs, descriptive statistics, pivot tables, data visualisation, analytical thinking

__Tech:__ Hubspot, Google sheets

__Results: [here is the report in pdf](https://github.com/outovhush/revops-data-portfolio/blob/main/Ad-hoc%20reports_AE%20WR%20lost%20deals%20quickstat_anon.pdf)__


## Data analysis and data hygiene
### Data quality check

Suppose you have to combine manual data entry with a sort of custom data structure that is not fully supported by default in your database. Entry errors become likely. Validations and automated checks are hardly an option at this stage. Once in a while you'd need a reality check to see true extent of errors in the database. Full manual check of the thousands of records is too expensive.
     
__Goal:__ Provide reliable estimate for the extent of data errors in the customer account database with the limited resources

__Steps:__
- figure out sample size given the CLT limitations for binomial
- set up the observations
- get the random sample
- check the sample manually collecting observations
- calculate sample means and confidence intervals

__Skills:__ Statistics (Binomial distribution, CLT), analytical thinking

__Tech:__ Google sheets

__Results: [Google sheets report with the assessment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/107Ku2k5vmR8ulyRyZNqTPoGAuRe9W2vTZqMGrSvtl5c/edit?gid=1064755575#gid=1064755575)__


### Critical datapoint error visualisation for CRM deals

__Goal:__ Visualise error in the deal datapoint that is critical for correct deal stat; make it easy for manual check-up and correction  

__Skills:__ Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualisation

__Tech:__ Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

__Code: [Example notebook_check deals source.ipynb](https://github.com/outovhush/revops-data-portfolio/blob/main/Example%20notebook_check%20deals%20source.ipynb)__

__Results: [image with clickable links in a standalone .pdf](https://github.com/outovhush/revops-data-portfolio/blob/main/deal_source_plot_Create_date.pdf)__


### Explore deal pipeline data and key correlations

__Goal:__ Estimate the extent of errors in the CRM company database 

__Skills:__ Statistics (correlation coefficient)

__Tech:__ Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

__Results:__

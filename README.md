Showcasing some examples of my work in sales and revenue operations


Hi I'm Andrew I have a background in natural sciences and physics. I  was always passionate about finding insights and uncovering the hidden gems. The natural sciences always worked the same way, a hypothesis would need be tested and validated in an experiment. The experiment would provided data that need to be carefully analysed to get at meaningful conclusions. So I got to understand things like random variables, distributions and 2SD before the Internet grew big and data analytics went mainstream.

My business background taught me that any data should make case for business. Rigorous analytics and good looking dynamic dashboards are no good unless they carry actionable insights that can have have a business impact.

In revenue operations your process should follow a well-defined methodology so that it can provide meaningful data-points for your data model. Then it takes a proper matching tool, a CRM, t capture them.  Unlike the Titanic dataset the real life data would have errors and inconsistencies, and must be laboriously cleaned and transformed before it is good enough for analysis. 
Here are few examples of my past work with data in sales operations.

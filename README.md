Showcasing some examples of my work in sales and revenue operations


Hi I'm Andrew I have a background in natural sciences and physics. I  was always passionate about finding insights and uncovering the hidden gems. The natural sciences always worked the same way, a hypothesis need to be tested and validated in an experiment. The experiment would provided data that need to be carefully analysed to get at the meaningful conclusions. So I got to understand things like random variables, distributions and 2SD before the Internet grew big and data analytics went mainstream.

My business background taught me that any data should make case for business. Rigorous analytics and dramatic dashboards are no good unless they carry actionable insights that can provide for a business impact.

In revenue operations your process should follow a well-defined methodology so that it can provide meaningful data-points to populate the data model. Then it takes a matching tool, the CRM, to capture them. Unlike the Titanic dataset the real life data would have errors and inconsistencies, and must be laboriously cleaned and transformed before it is good enough for analysis.

Here are few examples of my data work as the RevOps.

##Project 1

### Ad-hoc analytics focused on the reps' performance and deal lost reasons

Once in a while you spot an anomaly on the operating dashboards and need a quick dive into the specific area of the revenue or sales flow. Data is clean and the basics tool would do the job right and fast.

Goal: Assess the reps performance on the 'harder' deals that can not get won fast; get insights and support decision making  

Skills: HubSpot, pivot tables, data visualisation  

Tech: Google sheets

Showcasing some examples of my work in sales and revenue operations


Hi I'm Andrewüëã
 
I have a background in natural sciences and physics. I  have been always passionate about finding insights and uncovering the hidden knowledge gems in data. The natural sciences worked the same way, a theory need to be tested and validated in an experiment. The experiment would provided data that need to be carefully analysed to get at the conclusions. So I got to understand things like random variables, distributions and 2SD before the Internet grew big and data analytics went mainstream.

My background taught me that in business world any data work should make case for the business decisions. Rigorous analytics and dramatic dashboards are no use unless they carry actionable insights that can provide for a business impact.

If your revenue process follows a defined methodology it can provide the meaningful data-points. Then it takes a matching tool, the CRM, to capture them. Unlike the Titanic dataset the real life data samples would have errors and inconsistencies, and must be laboriously cleaned and transformed before it is good for the analysis.

Here are few examples of my practical work in the revenue operationsüëáüèº

## Project 1

### Ad-hoc analytics focused on the reps' performance and deal lost reasons

Once in a while you spot an anomaly on the operating dashboards and need a quick dive into the specific area of the revenue or sales flow. Data is clean and the basics tools would do the job fast.

__Goal:__ Assess the reps performance on the deals that take longer to close; get insights and support the decision making  

__Skills:__ Sales KPIs, descriptive statistics, pivot tables, data visualisation, analytical thinking

__Tech:__ Hubspot, Google sheets

__Results: [here is the report in pdf](https://github.com/outovhush/revops-data-portfolio/blob/main/Ad-hoc%20reports_AE%20WR%20lost%20deals%20quickstat_anon.pdf)__


## Project 2
### Data quality check

Suppose you have to combine manual data entry with a sort of custom data structure that is not fully supported by default in your database. Entry errors become likely. Validations and automated checks are hardly an option at this stage. Once in a while you'd need a reality check to see true extent of errors in the database. Full manual check of the thousands of records is too expensive.
     
__Goal:__ Provide reliable estimate for the extent of data errors in the customer account database with the limited resources

__Steps:__
- figure out sample size given the CLT limitations for binomial
- set up the observations
- get the random sample
- check the sample manually collecting observations
- calculate sample means and confidence intervals

__Skills:__ Statistics (Binomial distribution, CLT), analytical thinking

__Tech:__ Google sheets

__Results:__[Google sheets report with the assessment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/107Ku2k5vmR8ulyRyZNqTPoGAuRe9W2vTZqMGrSvtl5c/edit?gid=1064755575#gid=1064755575)


## Project 3
### Critical datapoint error visualisation for CRM deals

__Goal:__ Visualise error in the deal datapoint that is critial for correct deal stat; make it easy for manual check-up and correction  

__Skills:__ Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualisation

__Tech:__ Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

__Code:__ [Example notebook_check deals source.ipynb](https://github.com/outovhush/revops-data-portfolio/blob/main/Example%20notebook_check%20deals%20source.ipynb)

__Results: [image with clickable links in a standalone .pdf](https://github.com/outovhush/revops-data-portfolio/blob/main/deal_source_plot_Create_date.pdf)__


## Project 4
### Explore deal pipeline data and key correlations

__Goal:__ Estimate the extent of errors in the CRM company database 

__Skills:__ Statistics (correlation coefficient)

__Tech:__ Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

__Results:__ 


## Project 5
### RevOps is also about Business Analysis


__Goal:__ Provide a visual representation of a business process for the various use cases (analysis, new rep onboarding etc) 

__Skills:__ Business analysis, BPMN

__Tech:__
